# New Astra Work — CURRENT STATE

Updated: 2026-09-18 UTC
Active branch: `astra-work`
Canonical handoff: `docs/checkpoints/CURRENT_STATE.md`
Status: **MILESTONE 0 — NEW LINE ESTABLISHED; BACKEND SNAPSHOT NEXT; NO REAL-AUDIO QUALITY CLAIM**

## Product outcome

Jimmy PAIge powers `dadrocktabs.com/ai-tab`: upload audio, select bass / rhythm / lead guitar, receive accurate playable tab preview, optionally purchase the complete professional-quality PDF. The frontend is complete from the user's perspective. Backend musical quality is the priority.

Success requires requested-part separation, note/chord inference, onset/duration/technique accuracy, musical structure/rhythm, playable fingering and readable preview/full-PDF output. No single pitch percentage establishes the complete outcome.

## User decision and scope

On 2026-09-18 the user authorized archiving BOTH prior lines, starting New Astra Work, assembling their best qualities, and saving clean backend work after every major step for crash-resistant fresh-chat handoffs.

Active implementation and CPU synthetic verification may proceed in the new backend. No production change, paid/model-bearing execution, reclassification of historical results, or reopening of restricted datasets is implied. Previously exposed data cannot become an untouched final test by renaming the project.

## Archived baselines

- V143: `v143-contextual-prune-lobo` at `99e05eacbc3d8a38208ed41edadeee5b2f823c7b`.
- Songsterr Fresh: `songsterr-fresh-pipeline-v1` at `7be69898cf3eb7ae32cbe8963714895ad99c5853`.
- Exact original checkpoint snapshots and source blob IDs: `docs/checkpoints/archive/` and `docs/astra/ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.json`.
- Previous instructions to resume comparator recovery or RWC corpus hunting are archived task queues, not Astra's default next action.
- Preserve all old FAIL/PASS/provenance outcomes. V143 headline metrics remain unverified; current Fresh candidate real correctness remains unknown.

## What to retain

- Fresh: isolated deterministic musical structure, chord-shape assignment, contextual rhythm spelling, phrase-level fretboard optimization, product payload adapter and synthetic tests.
- V143: documented complete-song/PDF delivery experience, explicit traceability, and async ownership lessons (1800s result/control lifetime, 1200s orchestrator timeout, 600s margin). These are inherited design constraints to verify at integration, not a claim of an implemented Astra service.
- Existing frontend: upload/role request, generatedTab plus renderEvents/techniques/structure metadata, watermarked preview and unlock/full PDF.
- Neither legacy scorer, song-specific pruning rules nor unverifiable quality numbers will be imported as Astra acceptance criteria.

## Milestones

0. Establish durable checkpoint, archival source identities and repository instructions. COMPLETE with this commit.
1. Copy the isolated deterministic backend to `astra_backend/`, retain original file hashes, run existing CPU synthetic suite, save the result. NEXT.
2. Specify the full-chain input/output and benchmark contracts: separate development/final evaluation, bass/lead/rhythm coverage, source-separation versus transcription versus rendering errors, completeness as well as precision, cost/latency budget and stop conditions. Not yet implemented.
3. Build an offline adapter and representative synthetic end-to-end fixtures against that contract. No live deployment.
4. Select a lawful affordable real-audio development/evaluation plan, then execute only within the applicable authorization. Not authorized by this checkpoint alone.

Do not assume training a new neural model from scratch is necessary or affordable. Compare component options against measured product failures before selecting the audio engine.

## Current evidence and limitations

- No Astra model has been trained, no real audio processed, and no customer-quality score exists.
- Frontend inspected on main at `bb992d901e78ab19645f8edc8e330d5a142ebd8e`; no live upload/payment/email test performed.
- No customer eligibility or delivery authorization is granted.
- Git preserves committed work; it cannot guarantee recovery of unsaved changes during an abrupt crash.

## Save / resume protocol

For every major milestone, save code, meaningful tests, provenance and this checkpoint in the same commit. Record verified results, blockers, active files, exact next action and parent/source commit IDs. Verify the commit exists on remote `astra-work`. Use the commit containing this checkpoint as its identity; do not create self-referential commit-hash edits.

At chat handoff: inspect branch/HEAD/status, read this file and AGENTS.md, then continue only the current milestone. If a tool or test fails, record it and the recovery step. Git history plus immutable snapshots is the durable record; chat memory is supplementary.

## Copy-paste handoff

Continue Jimmy PAIge from `docs/checkpoints/CURRENT_STATE.md` on branch `astra-work` in `dadrockyt-sys/dadrock-tabs-android`. Read AGENTS.md first. Both V143/Gomyway and Songsterr Fresh are archived; do not resume their old task queues. Work on the active Astra milestone, preserve historical outcomes, and commit/push clean backend work plus this checkpoint after each major step. Do not modify main or Production.
